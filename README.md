# About

[I](https://nimrodpar.github.io/) created this glossary due to a recent program analysis exploration task. I found myself struggling to keep up with the jargon and all the (many) different kinds of analyses.

The glossary is example-oriented, and almost all of the terms are explained using code and an analysis result on the code for that type of analysis. You will find an explanation (if needed) in the comments section.

# Correctness / Disclaimer / Contributing

The slides are fairly new and may very well contain mistakes! Please report them via issues. You are also welcome to ask questions, point out gaps and either suggest or request additions. I will try my best to address issues ASAP.

Cheers 🍻
